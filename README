Updated 16/April/2014

To build:

There are three NetBeans projects that you will need
 * EXEMobile2 - the main project
 * UI - a modified version of LWUIT that supports bitmap arabic fonts
 * MIDP_UI - part of LWUIT required to build (unmodified from stock LWUIT)

1. Check out all the projects needed for the build 

cd ~/NetBeansProjects
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ustadmobil/ustadmobilcode EXEMobile2
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ustadmobil/codelwuitnokiaui LWUIT_for_Series_40

2. Open the required projects in NetBeans:
UstadMobile from directory ~/NetBeansProjects/EXEMobile2
UI from ~/NetBeansProjects/ustadmobil-codelwuitnokiaui/UI
UI-MIDP from ~/NetBeansProjects/ustadmobil-codelwuitnokiaui/Ports/MIDP/UI
IO from ~/NetBeansProjects/ustadmobil-codelwuitnokiaui/IO
IO-MIDP from ~/NetBeansProjects/ustadmobil-codelwuitnokiaui/Ports/MIDP/IO

3. Build the projects (right click and select clean/build): 
    UI, IO, IO_MIDP, UI-MIDP, JazzJ2MEMob

4. Copy exemobile2-build.sample.properties to exemobile2-build.properties

3. Set the paths in exemobile2-build.properties so that the compilation can find 
   required libraries mentioned

4. Download MicroEmu (2.0.4) from https://code.google.com/p/microemu/ 

5. Resolve any reference problems in NetBeans and make sure that you have a suitable 
   Wireless Toolkit (WTK) installed - this has been tested with 2.5.2 building in Linux

6. Note: if receiving an invalid first byte 100... RuntimeException on Linux under
    emulator add this line to /opt/WTK2.5.2/wtklib/Linux/ktools.properties
 
   microedition.encoding= *encoding*

NOTE: This has been switched to using Nokia's implementation of LWUIT
