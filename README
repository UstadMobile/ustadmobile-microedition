Ustad Mobil README

Updated 23/June/2013

To build:

There are three NetBeans projects that you will need
 * EXEMobile2 - the main project
 * UI - a modified version of LWUIT that supports bitmap arabic fonts
 * MIDP_UI - part of LWUIT required to build (unmodified from stock LWUIT)

1. Check out all the projects needed for the build

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ustadmobil/ustadmobilcode EXEMobile2
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ustadmobil/codelwuitui UI
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ustadmobil/codelwuitmidpui MIDP_UI

2. exemobile2-build.sample.properties to exemobile2-build.properties

3. Set the paths in exemobile2-build.properties so that the compilation can find 
   required libraries

4. Resolve any reference problems in NetBeans and make sure that you have a suitable 
   Wireless Toolkit (WTK) installed - this has been tested with 2.5.2 building in Linux

5. Note: if receiving an invalid first byte 100... RuntimeException on Linux under
    emulator add this line to /opt/WTK2.5.2/wtklib/Linux/ktools.properties
 
   microedition.encoding= *encoding*
