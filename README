Ustad Mobil README

Updated 23/June/2013

To build:

There are three NetBeans projects that you will need
 * EXEMobile2 - the main project
 * UI - a modified version of LWUIT that supports bitmap arabic fonts
 * MIDP_UI - part of LWUIT required to build (unmodified from stock LWUIT)

1. Copy exemobile2-build.sample.properties to exemobile2-build.properties

2. Set the paths in exemobile2-build.properties so that the compilation can find 
   required libraries

3. Resolve any reference problems in NetBeans and make sure that you have a suitable 
   Wireless Toolkit (WTK) installed - this has been tested with 2.5.2 building in Linux
